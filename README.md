# Racer
Retro Racer style game written in the OLCPixelGameEngine

Hello!

If you want to edit the tracks you can.

Just write the curve you want and distance for a section of track like this:

Curve Distance
0.0f 100.0f 
1.0f 200.0f


Values go between -1.0f and 1.0f for curve. 200.f is roughly two seconds of driving.
